Hand Gesture Recognition Model

Overview

This project focuses on building a hand gesture recognition model using a dataset from Kaggle. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify different hand gestures.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: LeapGestRecog Dataset.
